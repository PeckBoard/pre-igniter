const DESCRIPTION =
  "Pre-hatcher: pre-warms chat messages before they reach the main model. Each intercepted message starts with a plain opt-in question card (no AI involved) — declining sends the message unchanged; accepting has a cheaper model gather repository context in a temp session, WITH THE FULL CHAT TRANSCRIPT in view. The research model runs under a configurable library system prompt (default 'fable 5'), always asks a clarifying question when the request is ambiguous, and proposes an enriched message that is delivered only after the user approves it on a second plain question card (declining delivers the original). An in-flight pre-hatch can be cancelled from its chat bubble: the research agent is stopped and the original message is sent untouched.";
