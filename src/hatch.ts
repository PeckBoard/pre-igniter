// The pre-hatch flow. Pure decision/formatting helpers are exported for
// vitest; everything touching host functions stays in the two handlers.
//
// Flow:
//  1. `session.message.before` fires for an interactive chat message. If the
//     session's provider has a cheaper model (or the user picked an override
//     in Settings) and no pre-hatch is already pending, create a temp
//     research session on that model, dispatch the GATEKEEPER prompt (which
//     holds until the user opts in), and raise the plugin-authored (no AI)
//     opt-in question on the chat session. The answer is redirected to the
//     temp session — core resumes a question's target directly and never
//     re-fires this hook for it, so the temp agent is the only place the
//     answer can be acted on. Cancel the hook — core parks the message as a
//     `pre-hatch` placeholder event. The cancel verdict carries
//     `{temp_session_id, model}` so the UI can stream the temp session's
//     actions into the parked bubble.
//  2. The user's answer resumes the temp session. A decline (or dismissal)
//     makes the agent call `pre_hatch_result` with `pass` immediately, so
//     the original message is delivered untouched; an accept starts the
//     research.
//  3. The temp agent researches the repo and calls the `pre_hatch_result`
//     MCP tool: `pass` delivers the original message, `enrich` PROPOSES the
//     context-enriched message, `ask` raises ONE clarifying question on the
//     chat session (the answer redirects back to the temp session, which then
//     finishes with enrich/pass).
//  4. An enrich proposal is never delivered directly: the plugin raises a
//     plugin-authored (no AI) approval card on the chat session showing the
//     expanded text, answer redirected to the temp session again. The temp
//     agent's only remaining job is to call `finalize`; the plugin reads the
//     user's RECORDED answer via `peckboard_get_answer` (core is the source
//     of truth — the agent cannot forge approval or alter the text) and
//     delivers the stored expanded message on approval, the original
//     otherwise.
//  5. Delivery goes through `peckboard_deliver_message`, which persists the
//     final `user` event (carrying `pre_hatch: {original, enriched}` so the
//     UI swaps the placeholder for it), broadcasts, and resumes the chat.
